##About
This project is devoted to creating a tool for interactive art. By linking together WIFI, LEDs, and Sensors, artists will be able to create complex interactive works without the overhead of hacking together existing interfaces or designing new hardware from scratch.

DREAM utilizes the Arduino framework, ESP8266 modules, and a few sensors to create a maluable user interface with minimal restrictions.
